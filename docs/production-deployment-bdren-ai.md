# Production deployment — chat.bdren.ai

A reviewable plan for hosting `synapse` (the app) and `synapse-admin` (the admin
panel) on `203.96.189.213`, with the code interpreter staying on
`203.96.189.202`.

**Nothing in this document has been executed.** Every command is proposed. Read
§3 first — it contains the one architectural change that the two-server split
forces, and two decisions only you can make.

---

## 1. Verified starting state

Checked directly, not assumed:

| | App server | Interpreter server |
|---|---|---|
| Address | `203.96.189.213` → `chat.bdren.ai` ✅ | `203.96.189.202` → `interpreter.bdren.ai` ✅ |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS, kernel 6.8 | Ubuntu, Docker |
| Hardware | 8 cores, 31 GB RAM, 457 GB free | — |
| Installed | **git only** — no node, npm, bun, pm2, mongod, nginx, redis, docker, certbot | Docker stack running, healthy |
| Open ports | 22 only | 22 only — all service ports are loopback-bound |
| sudo | passwordless | requires password |
| SSH | `id_ed25519`, user `bdren` | `bdren_interpreter`, user `bdren` |

Both DNS records resolve correctly. The app server is a clean machine — this is
a first-time provision, not a redeploy.

---

## 2. Target architecture

```
                    Internet
                       │
        ┌──────────────┴───────────────┐
        │                              │
  chat.bdren.ai                 interpreter.bdren.ai
  203.96.189.213                203.96.189.202
        │                              │
   nginx :443 (TLS, HTTP/2)      nginx :443 (TLS)
        │                         ↑ firewall: .213 only
   ┌────┴─────┬──────────┐             │
   │          │          │        Docker stack
 Synapse    Admin      static      (api, sandbox,
 :3080      :3000      assets       redis, minio…)
   │          │                    all loopback-bound
   └────┬─────┘
        │
  MongoDB :27017 ── Redis :6379   (both loopback-only)
```

Everything except nginx binds to `127.0.0.1`. Only 22, 80 and 443 are ever
publicly reachable on either host.

---

## 3. Read this before anything else

### 3.1 The interpreter is currently unreachable from the app server

This is a direct consequence of the security fix applied earlier. The
interpreter's port 3112 is bound to `127.0.0.1` on `.202`. That was correct when
the app ran on the same box (or reached it through an SSH tunnel from your Mac).
**Now the app lives on a different machine, so it cannot reach the interpreter at
all until §4 is done.**

Two ways to bridge it:

| Option | How | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| **A. nginx + TLS + IP allowlist** (recommended) | `interpreter.bdren.ai` over 443, firewalled to `.213` only | Encrypted, survives reboots, no moving parts. Matches the DNS record you already created |
| B. Persistent SSH tunnel | systemd unit on `.213` holding `-L 3112:127.0.0.1:3112` | No certificate needed, but a background process that can die; you have already been bitten by exactly this in dev |

This plan uses **A**. The DNS record for `interpreter.bdren.ai` suggests that was
your intent anyway.

### 3.2 Decision: MongoDB topology

Quota **enforcement** needs multi-document transactions, which need a replica
set. Shadow-mode accounting does not.

- **Recommended:** provision as a single-node replica set from day one (§5.3).
  It is the same single `mongod` process, costs nothing, and converting later
  means downtime plus a keyFile dance on a live database.
- Shadow mode still runs regardless; enforcement stays off until the readiness
  gate passes.

### 3.3 Decision: admin panel exposure

`synapse-admin` is a platform-superadmin console. Options:

1. **Same host, path-based:** `chat.bdren.ai/admin` — simplest, one certificate.
2. **Separate subdomain:** `admin.bdren.ai` — needs another DNS record and cert.
3. **Not public at all:** bind to `127.0.0.1:3000`, reach it over an SSH tunnel.

**Recommended: option 3 for launch**, moving to 2 later if other staff need
access. It is a console that can suspend institutions and rewrite quota policy;
there is no reason for it to face the internet during a pilot. Nothing in the
app depends on it being public.

---

## 4. Interpreter server (`203.96.189.202`)

Publishes the interpreter to the app server only. Requires your password (sudo
is not passwordless here).

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/bdren_interpreter bdren@203.96.189.202

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx

sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/interpreter > /dev/null <<'EOF'
server {
    server_name interpreter.bdren.ai;
    client_max_body_size 50M;          # matches CODEAPI_HTTP_JSON_LIMIT
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3112;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 330s;       # > SANDBOX_RUN_TIMEOUT (300s)
        proxy_buffering off;           # keeps streamed output flowing
    }
    listen 80;
}
EOF

sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/interpreter /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d interpreter.bdren.ai

# Firewall: 443 reachable only from the app server.
# Port 80 must stay open to the world — Let's Encrypt's HTTP-01 challenge
# reaches it from arbitrary validation servers, at issuance AND at every
# renewal. Restricting 80 to .213 makes certbot fail with a confusing
# connection timeout. It only ever serves the ACME challenge and a redirect.
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow from 203.96.189.213 to any port 443 proto tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

Leave the container port bindings alone — they are already loopback-only, which
is what makes this safe. `ufw` does not filter Docker-published ports (Docker
writes its own iptables rules ahead of ufw), so the loopback binding is the
control that matters, not the firewall.

**Verify:** `curl -fsS https://interpreter.bdren.ai/v1/health` succeeds from
`.213` and times out from anywhere else.

---

## 5. App server (`203.96.189.213`)

Passwordless sudo, so this section can run unattended.

### 5.1 Base packages and hardening

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git ufw fail2ban

sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable

sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban
```

### 5.2 Node 24 + Bun + PM2

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash        # admin panel runs on Bun
sudo npm install -g pm2
pm2 startup systemd -u bdren --hp /home/bdren   # prints a command to run with sudo
```

Bun is required: `synapse-admin`'s production start is `bun server.ts`.

### 5.3 MongoDB 8.0 as a single-node replica set

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-8.0.asc | \
  sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg --dearmor
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg ] \
https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu noble/mongodb-org/8.0 multiverse" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
sudo systemctl enable --now mongod
```

Create the application user **before** enabling auth:

```bash
mongosh --eval 'db.getSiblingDB("admin").createUser({
  user: "synapse", pwd: "REPLACE_STRONG_PASSWORD",
  roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "Synapse"}, {role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin"}]
})'
```

Then the keyFile (mandatory once auth **and** replication are both on — omitting
it leaves `mongod` refusing to start), replication, and cache sizing:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/mongodb
openssl rand -base64 756 | sudo tee /etc/mongodb/keyfile > /dev/null
sudo chown mongodb:mongodb /etc/mongodb/keyfile && sudo chmod 400 /etc/mongodb/keyfile

sudo tee -a /etc/mongod.conf > /dev/null <<'EOF'
replication:
  replSetName: rs0
EOF
# under the existing `security:` block add:
#   authorization: enabled
#   keyFile: /etc/mongodb/keyfile
# under `storage:` add (≈40% of 31 GB, leaving room for Node and Redis):
#   wiredTiger:
#     engineConfig:
#       cacheSizeGB: 12

sudo systemctl restart mongod
mongosh -u synapse -p --authenticationDatabase admin \
  --eval 'rs.initiate({_id:"rs0",members:[{_id:0,host:"127.0.0.1:27017"}]})'
mongosh -u synapse -p --authenticationDatabase admin --eval 'rs.status().myState'   # expect 1
```

`mongod` binds to `127.0.0.1` by default — keep it that way.

### 5.4 Redis

```bash
sudo apt install -y redis-server
sudo sed -i 's/^# *requirepass .*/requirepass REPLACE_STRONG_REDIS_PASSWORD/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo sed -i 's/^bind .*/bind 127.0.0.1 -::1/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo sed -i 's/^# *maxmemory .*/maxmemory 4gb/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo sed -i 's/^# *maxmemory-policy .*/maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo systemctl enable --now redis-server && redis-cli -a REPLACE_STRONG_REDIS_PASSWORD ping
```

`allkeys-lru` is deliberate: this Redis is a cache and stream buffer, not a
system of record. If it fills, evicting the coldest key is correct; refusing
writes would take the app down.

### 5.5 Deploy the application

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/synapse && sudo chown bdren:bdren /opt/synapse
git clone -b bdren-prod https://github.com/nafew0/synapse.git /opt/synapse
cd /opt/synapse
npm run smart-reinstall        # installs, then builds every workspace
```

Write `/opt/synapse/.env` from your dev `.env`, changing everything in §7. Then:

```bash
node config/migrate-usage-policies.js --dry-run
node config/migrate-usage-policies.js       # only if the dry run is clean
```

Run the migration **before** traffic: until every `tenantId` has an Institution
row, those users hit the fail-closed quota path.

### 5.6 Admin panel

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/synapse-admin && sudo chown bdren:bdren /opt/synapse-admin
git clone -b bdren-prod https://github.com/nafew0/synapse-admin.git /opt/synapse-admin
cd /opt/synapse-admin && bun install && bun run build
```

`.env` needs `SESSION_SECRET` (32+ chars — `bun run start` refuses to boot
without it; the dev fallback only applies to `bun run dev`) and the Synapse API
base URL.

### 5.7 PM2

`/opt/synapse/ecosystem.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'synapse',
      script: 'api/server/index.js',
      cwd: '/opt/synapse',
      instances: 2,               // see §6.2 before increasing
      exec_mode: 'cluster',
      max_memory_restart: '2G',
      env: { NODE_ENV: 'production' },
    },
    {
      name: 'synapse-admin',
      script: 'bun',
      args: 'server.ts',
      cwd: '/opt/synapse-admin',
      instances: 1,
      exec_mode: 'fork',
      env: { NODE_ENV: 'production', PORT: '3000' },
    },
  ],
};
```

```bash
pm2 start /opt/synapse/ecosystem.config.js && pm2 save
```

### 5.8 nginx + TLS

```bash
sudo apt install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx

sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/synapse > /dev/null <<'EOF'
upstream synapse {
    server 127.0.0.1:3080;
    keepalive 64;                       # reuse connections; avoids per-request TCP setup
}

server {
    server_name chat.bdren.ai;
    client_max_body_size 100M;          # file uploads

    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript
               application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml image/svg+xml;
    gzip_min_length 1024;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://synapse;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Token streaming dies without these two.
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_read_timeout 600s;
    }

    listen 80;
}
EOF

sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/synapse /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d chat.bdren.ai      # adds 443, HTTP/2 and the redirect
```

`proxy_buffering off` is not optional. With buffering on, nginx holds the SSE
stream and responses arrive in one lump at the end — the app appears frozen
during generation.

---

## 6. Performance

### 6.1 Set expectations honestly

For an LLM chat application, **perceived speed is dominated by model provider
latency and time-to-first-token**, not by this server. With 8 cores and 31 GB
serving a pilot, CPU will not be the bottleneck. Redis and clustering protect
throughput under concurrency and make the UI feel instant *around* the model
call; they do not make tokens arrive faster.

The changes that will actually be felt, ordered by impact:

| Change | Effect |
|---|---|
| HTTP/2 + TLS session resumption (certbot default) | Fewer round trips on every page load |
| Brotli static assets + immutable caching | First load smaller; repeat loads near-instant |
| Redis caching of config, roles and permissions | Removes repeated Mongo reads from the hot path |
| nginx upstream keepalive | No TCP handshake per proxied request |
| `proxy_buffering off` | Tokens stream as generated instead of arriving in a lump |
| PM2 cluster | Concurrency, not single-request latency |
| MongoDB WiredTiger cache 12 GB | Working set stays in RAM |

### 6.2 Redis and clustering

Add to `.env`:

```bash
USE_REDIS=true
USE_REDIS_STREAMS=true
REDIS_URI=redis://:REPLACE_STRONG_REDIS_PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:6379
REDIS_KEY_PREFIX=synapse
```

`USE_REDIS_STREAMS=true` is what makes cluster mode safe: resumable LLM streams
move out of per-worker memory, so a reconnect handled by a different worker still
finds the stream.

**Known caveat — the quota reconciler runs per worker.** It is started with
`setInterval` in `api/server/index.js`, so with `instances: 2` it runs twice a
minute instead of once. It is idempotent and derives its work from the
reservation ledger, so this is wasted effort rather than corruption. Mitigation,
in preference order:

1. Start at `instances: 2`, confirm behaviour under real traffic, then scale.
2. If you go beyond ~4 workers, gate the interval on
   `process.env.NODE_APP_INSTANCE === '0'` (PM2 sets this per worker). That is a
   one-line code change and should be reviewed, not slipped in during a deploy.

### 6.3 Static assets

```bash
ENABLE_STATIC_ASSET_BROTLI=true
STATIC_CACHE_MAX_AGE=31536000
STATIC_CACHE_S_MAX_AGE=86400
```

The app already serves precompressed assets and sets cache headers itself
(`api/server/utils/staticCache.js`), so nginx does not need to duplicate this —
which is why the nginx block above only gzips dynamic responses.

### 6.4 Search (optional)

Meilisearch powers conversation search. It is a separate service with its own
memory footprint. Leave `SEARCH=false` for launch and add it once the pilot is
stable — it is additive and needs no migration.

---

## 7. Production `.env` — what must change from dev

| Key | Dev | Production |
|---|---|---|
| `DOMAIN_CLIENT` | `http://localhost:3090` | `https://chat.bdren.ai` |
| `DOMAIN_SERVER` | `http://localhost:3080` | `https://chat.bdren.ai` |
| `MONGO_URI` | `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/LibreChat` | `mongodb://synapse:PASS@127.0.0.1:27017/Synapse?replicaSet=rs0&authSource=admin` |
| `LIBRECHAT_CODE_BASEURL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3112/v1` | `https://interpreter.bdren.ai/v1` |
| `RAG_API_URL` | unset | `https://rag.bdren.ai` (see `plans/rag-api-deployment.md`) |
| `RAG_JWT_SECRET` | unset | a new random value (`openssl rand -hex 32`); rag_api's `JWT_SECRET` must equal it. Keeps RAG tokens off the login secret |
| `ADMIN_PANEL_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | per §3.3 |
| `NODE_ENV` | — | `production` |
| `USE_REDIS`, `REDIS_URI` | unset | §6.2 |
| `LIBRECHAT_LOG_DIR` | unset | `/opt/synapse/api/logs` |

Two naming notes:

- **`LIBRECHAT_LOG_DIR` keeps its name** — it is read by
  `@librechat/data-schemas`, so renaming the variable would simply stop working.
  Set it explicitly: with it unset the package picks the log directory by testing
  whether the working directory path contains "LibreChat", and `/opt/synapse`
  does not, so logs would land somewhere non-obvious.
- **The production database is `Synapse`, while dev is `LibreChat`.** Restoring a
  dev dump into production (or the reverse) therefore needs an explicit namespace
  mapping — `mongorestore` will otherwise recreate the source database name
  alongside the real one:

  ```bash
  mongorestore --uri "$MONGO_URI" --archive=dump.gz --gzip \
    --nsFrom 'LibreChat.*' --nsTo 'Synapse.*'
  ```

**Regenerate, do not copy:** `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, `CREDS_KEY`,
`CREDS_IV`, `MEILI_MASTER_KEY`, `METRICS_SECRET`, and the admin panel's
`SESSION_SECRET`. Dev values have been on a developer laptop.

**Provider keys** are referenced from `librechat.yaml` as `${NAME}`, so each one
named there must exist in `.env` or the endpoint will authenticate with the
literal placeholder text and every request to it fails with a 401:

| Key | Used by |
|---|---|
| `OPENROUTER_KEY` | OpenRouter endpoint — Kimi K2.6, Nano Banana 2 |
| `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | NVIDIA endpoint — GLM 5.2 (`https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`) |

A missing provider key degrades only its own endpoint; the rest of the
application still starts.

**Carry across unchanged:** `PLATFORM_SUPERADMIN_EMAILS` (without it nobody can
reach the platform console on a fresh database — the implicit "first user becomes
superadmin" bootstrap was removed as a privilege-escalation hole) and
`ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` (self-signup is closed; invitations bypass this switch
via `req.invite`, so onboarding is unaffected).

The interpreter JWT keypair (`CODEAPI_*`) must match `.202`. Re-mint it rather
than copying the dev key, which was exposed in a terminal transcript.

---

## 7a. Default agent and model parameters

`librechat.yaml` is version controlled (see [`../deploy/README.md`](../deploy/README.md)),
so provider and capability settings reach the server through `git pull`. Agent
records live in MongoDB and are *not* covered by that — they must be recreated if
the host is rebuilt.

**The Document Assistant agent is selectable, not forced.** Code execution is an
*agent capability*, not a model feature: a bare model chat has no tools, so
asking it for a `.docx` yields text to copy rather than a file. The agent with
`execute_code` supplies that, and users pick it from the agents list in the left
menu.

An earlier revision pinned it as a default `modelSpec`. That was withdrawn — it
took over every new conversation and, worse, `modelSpecs` references an agent by
id, and agent ids are per-database. Committing one made the shared config valid
only on the machine whose database contained that agent, which broke local
development outright. **Do not put agent ids in `librechat.yaml`.**

**Two provider constraints the agent works around:**

- **OpenAI reasoning models** reject `reasoning_effort` together with function
  tools on `/v1/chat/completions`. The agent sets
  `model_parameters.useResponsesApi: true`, which supports both. Setting effort
  to `none` also works but gives up reasoning.
- **Anthropic extended thinking** breaks tool loops: the continuation omits the
  thinking block and the API returns
  `messages.1.content.0.thinking.thinking: Field required`. Anthropic models are
  therefore fine for plain chat but should have `thinking` disabled before being
  given tools.
- **`addParams` keys are camelCase.** They are matched against LangChain's
  parameter names, so `maxTokens` sets the output limit while `max_tokens` is
  silently forwarded as an unrecognised model kwarg. `addParams` is also applied
  *after* the user's own settings, so anything listed there pins the
  corresponding slider instead of seeding it — list only what genuinely must not
  vary. This is why the NVIDIA endpoint sets `maxTokens` but leaves temperature
  and top_p alone: the UI already defaults both to 1.

**Nano Banana 2 (`google/gemini-3.1-flash-image`) returns images, not just
text.** Custom endpoints in this fork are built around a text-chat response
shape, so if generated pictures do not render in the conversation the fix is to
serve the model through the existing `GeminiImageGen` tool instead of as a
selectable chat model. That tool calls Google directly and therefore needs a
Google API key rather than going through OpenRouter billing.

---

## 8. Pre-flight gates

Do not open to users until all pass. Full detail in
[`production-runbook.md`](./production-runbook.md) §1.

```bash
node -e "require('dotenv').config();
['JWT_SECRET','JWT_REFRESH_SECRET','CREDS_KEY','CREDS_IV','METRICS_SECRET',
 'PLATFORM_SUPERADMIN_EMAILS','DOMAIN_CLIENT','ALLOW_REGISTRATION','REDIS_URI']
.forEach(k=>console.log((process.env[k]?'ok      ':'MISSING ')+k))"
```

Plus: `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false`; every institution policy in `shadow`; nothing
but 22/80/443 reachable on either host; and `interpreter.bdren.ai` reachable from
`.213` but nowhere else.

---

## 9. Verification

```bash
curl -fsS https://chat.bdren.ai/health                       # 200
curl -sI https://chat.bdren.ai | grep -i "^HTTP\|strict-transport"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://chat.bdren.ai/metrics          # 401
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $METRICS_SECRET" \
  https://chat.bdren.ai/metrics                                                  # 200
pm2 logs synapse --lines 50 | grep -i "institution model is not registered"    # expect none
```

Then, by hand: log in as the superadmin, open the platform console, invite a test
member, accept the invitation in a private window, send a message, and request a
`.docx`. That last one exercises the full path — app → interpreter over TLS →
sandbox → file back — which nothing else covers.

---

## 10. Rollback

```bash
cd /opt/synapse && git log --oneline -5
git checkout <previous-sha> && npx turbo build --force && pm2 restart synapse
```

No migration in this release destroys data — the policy migration only adds rows
and indexes — so rolling code back is safe without touching the database. Feature
flags that act as instant switches (`TENANT_REQUIRE_REGISTERED_INSTITUTION`,
per-institution `mode: shadow`) are in the runbook §3.

---

## 11. Open risks

1. **The interpreter is a single point of failure and a separate host.** If
   `.202` or the TLS cert lapses, document generation stops. Certbot renewal
   should be verified with `sudo certbot renew --dry-run` on both hosts.
2. **`.213` is a single machine.** No redundancy. Acceptable for a pilot;
   note it before general availability.
3. **Backups are not automated by this plan.** Add the nightly `mongodump` from
   runbook §4 as a cron job on day one, and prove a restore before onboarding a
   second institution.
4. **Enforcement stays off.** Shadow mode collects everything needed to size
   limits. Turning it on is a later, deliberate step behind the readiness gate.
5. **`.202` still has dev-era exposure history.** Its ports are loopback-bound
   now, but it was briefly internet-reachable. Rotating the interpreter's JWT
   keypair and internal service tokens during this deployment is cheap insurance.
